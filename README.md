# Task 4 - Firewall Configuration

## 🔐 Objective:
Set up and use a firewall on Windows or Linux to control network traffic using specific rules.

## 🧪 What I Did:
- Used **Windows Defender Firewall** to configure firewall rules.
- Blocked **Telnet (port 23)** to test inbound traffic filtering.
- Verified the block using Telnet.
- Removed the rule to restore system to original state.
- Documented GUI steps and firewall behavior.

## 📁 Files Included:
- `windows_firewall_steps.md`: Step-by-step GUI instructions.
- `linux_ufw_commands.txt`: UFW commands for Linux (for reference).
- `interview_questions.md`: Firewall-related interview questions with answers.
- `screenshots/`: Screenshots of rule creation, Telnet block test, and rule removal.

## ⚙️ Tools Used:
- **Windows 10/11 Defender Firewall**
- **Telnet Client** (installed via DISM command)

## ✅ Outcome:
Gained hands-on experience with firewall rule management and network traffic filtering.
